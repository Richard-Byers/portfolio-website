              Hello, I'm Richard Byers and I'm a software engineer based in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

              I am passionate about technology. Whether it comes down to the latest iPhone or recent AI advancements. I learned a lot during my time as an intern at Proofpoint and as a student at Queen's University of Belfast.

              Outside of programming I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, tv shows and Youtube videos and going to the gym(when I can be bothered!).
