            Software engineer by day, entertainment enthusiast by night!  That's me, Richard Byers, from Belfast, Northern Ireland.  
            I leverage my programming skills to build and work on improving full-stack applications.  My fascination with technology extends beyond coding. 
            The lessons I learned I have learned while at Proofpoint has been team work, effective communication, discipline, problem solving and adaptabililty. 
            Queen's University equipped me with the technical knowledge and problem-solving skills to excel in this field.
            When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me gaming - I find it's a great way to unwind and recharge. (Well when not playing eSports titles that is!)
